    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/" target="_blank">The HyperText Markup Language</a>, or HTML is the standard markup
        language for documents designed to be displayed in a web 
        browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading 
        Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from
        local storage and render the documents into multimedia web 
        pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically
         and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
